# RelationshipGraph
A program that yields graphs representing relationships (e.g. Facebook).
These relationship graphs are undirected graphs without any weights on the edges. They are simple graphs because there are no self loops or multiple edges. 

The vertices in the graphs represent two kinds of people: students and non-students. Each vertex stores the name of the person. If the person is a student, the name of the school will also be stored.
